NOW:
- DONE - Rewrite FfmpegRunnerSErvice, not to be AI fuckedup, and to properly handle and report states
  - DONE -  Maybe create some ffmpegInstanceState and update it based on FFmpeg logs
- DONE - Properly update destination state based on ffmpegInstanceState
- Handle restarts of FFMPEG process (retry a few times)
- Properly merge StreamInstance.ffmpegFlags and StreamDestination.ffmpegFlags
- Docker and Docker Compose support to run all of this shit

LATER:
 - Figure out what happens to running FFMPEG processes when backend crashes
 - In frontend, maybe clear up left-over react template tails (if any)


REMAINDERS:
 -API safety not tested. To test:
  - Can destination be edited/deleted if it's in use?
  - Can stream be edited/deleted if it's in use?
  - Can stream be double started?
